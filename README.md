<img src="public/demo.png"/>


###### What does the database thing do ?
- Backup/restore your database with an interative UI
- List all backups files in AWS S3
- Create a CRON to schedule automatic backups 
- Clear all redis keys after database update

## How to run

#### Run app
> Create .env file, run prisma migrations, and finally run the app
```bash
cp .env.example .env # Create .env and modify the AWS credentials.
npm install # install deps
npx prisma migrate dev # Create migrations in database
npm run dev # Run app
```

> The way I'm running in my env is using PM2
